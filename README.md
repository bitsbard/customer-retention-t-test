# Hypothesis Testing on E-Commerce Customer Segments

## Overview

This project extends the [Customer Segmentation Dashboard](https://github.com/bitsbard/customer-segmentation-dashboard) by experimenting with hypothesis testing on real-world e-commerce data. It focuses on analyzing customer retention through statistical methods, building on the segmented RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) data from the prior project.

Notebook: `CustomerRetentionTTest.ipynb` contains the complete analysis, including data exploration, hypothesis testing, and insights.

## Objective

The aim is to compare the recency (days since last purchase) between "At Risk" and "Others" customer segments to identify significant differences and inform retention strategies.

Null Hypothesis (H₀): The mean recency of "At Risk" customers equals that of "Others."

Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): The mean recency of "At Risk" customers is greater than that of "Others."
